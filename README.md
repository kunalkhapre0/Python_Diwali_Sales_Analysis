# Diwali Sales Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Diwali sales data** to uncover meaningful insights about customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and sales performance during the festive season. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, the notebook performs data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional and customer-level information related to Diwali sales, such as:

* User demographics (Gender, Age Group, Marital Status)
* Occupation and Product Categories
* Purchase Amount
* City and State details

The dataset used in this project is:

* **Diwali_Sales_Data.csv**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Handling missing and inconsistent values
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Sales analysis by:

  * Gender
  * Age group
  * State
  * Occupation
  * Product category
* Visualization of top-performing segments

## 📈 Key Insights

* Identified top states contributing to sales
* Analyzed which age group and gender contribute most to purchases
